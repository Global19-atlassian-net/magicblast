First you need to create a BLAST database for your genome or transcriptome. For a genome in a FASTA file genome.fa, use this command line:

```
makeblastdb -in genome.fa -dbtype nucl -parse_seqids -out <database_name> -title "Database title"
```

The ```-parse_seqids``` option is required to keep the original sequence identifiers. Otherwise makeblastdb will generate its own identifiers, ```-title``` is optional.

For more information on makeblastdb see [NCBI BLAST+ Command Line User Manual](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279688/).

Magic-BLAST will work with a genome in a FASTA file, but will be very slow for anything larger than a bacterial genome, so we do not recommend it.
