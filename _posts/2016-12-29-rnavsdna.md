By default, Magic-Blast aligns RNA reads to a genome and reports spliced
alignments, possibly spanning several exons. To disable spliced alignments,
use the ```-splice F``` option. Use the ```-reftype transcriptome``` option, to
map reads to a transcriptome database. These are example command lines:
```
magicblast -query reads.fa -db genome -splice F
```

```
magicblast -query reads.fa -db genome -reftype transcriptome
```

Magic-Blast finds alignments between a read and a genome based on initial
common word in both. To make mapping faster we first count word occurrences
in the genome and disregard those that occur too often. With the
```-reftype transcripts``` option the words that are frequent in the transcript
database are used for alignment.
