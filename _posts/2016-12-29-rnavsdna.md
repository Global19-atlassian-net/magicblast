##### Splicing

By default, Magic-BLAST aligns RNA reads to a genome and reports spliced
alignments, possibly spanning several exons. To disable spliced alignments,
use the ```-splice F``` option.

For example, mapping RNA or DNA reads to a bacterial genome:

```
magicblast -sra SRR5647973 -db salmonella_enterica_genome -splice F
```

&nbsp;

##### Transcriptome

Use the ```-reftype transcriptome``` option, to
map reads to a transcriptome database. For example:

```
magicblast -query reads.fa -db my_transcripts -reftype transcriptome
```

The ```-ref_type transcriptome``` option is a short hand for ```-splice F -limit_lookup F```, so the above call is equivalent to:

```magicblast -query reads.fa -db my_transcripts -splice F -limit_lookup F```

Magic-Blast finds alignments between a read and a genome based on initial
common word in both. Many genomes contain interspersed repeats that make mapping much more time consuming. To make mapping faster we disregard words that appear too often in the reference. This is not desirable when mapping to transcripts, because a transcript with many variants could be considered a repeat. The ```-limit_lookup F``` option turns this functionality off.
