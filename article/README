The present directory contains the main scripts used in the Magic-BLAST paper analysis
and can be used to replicate our analysis.
 
===========

The link for the paper is: https://github.com/ncbi/magicblast/tree/master/article

Please clone the site:
  git clone https://github.com/ncbi/magicblast
  cd magicblast/article
you should now see the present README file and 2 directories
  scripts: see scripts/README for a description of the content
  Aligners: see Aligners/README for a description of the content
and a link to the main script:
  MagicBlastPaperMasterScript.tcsh

Try
  tcsh MagicBlastPaperMasterScript.tcsh --help
to see the list of the commands

============

You can control the number of runs to be analyzed
by editing the definition of the variable $runs, around line 50
of the main script  MagicBlastPaperMasterScript.tcsh

You can control the number of aligners to be analyzed
by editing the definition of the variable $methods, around line 27
of the main script  MagicBlastPaperMasterScript.tcsh

============

init:

  Please run
    tcsh MagicBlastPaperMasterScript.tcsh init

  This command should download from NCBI the linux binaries and the reference genomes used in this benchmark
i.e. the 2 Baruzzo genomes for their human and their P.falciparum test sets  ls -ls Reference_genome/
and the GRCh38 human genome which is used for iRefSeq and the Illumina, Roche and Pacbio runs

       4 -rw-r--r--. 1 mieg biodata      1230 Aug  6 15:37 HG19.Baruzzo.genome.TM.txt
  915076 -rw-r--r--. 1 mieg biodata 937034891 Aug  6 15:37 HG19.Baruzzo.genome.fasta.gz
       4 -rw-r--r--. 1 mieg biodata       869 Aug  6 15:37 PFAL.Baruzzo.genome.TM.txt
    6260 -rw-r--r--. 1 mieg biodata   6408381 Aug  6 15:37 PFAL.Baruzzo.genome.fasta.gz

  init also creates the Fasta directory, but does not yet import the runs

  The binaries are compiled for Linux 64bits Intel processors. See bin/README for details

============

download:

  Please run
    tcsh MagicBlastPaperMasterScript.tcsh download
  This command may take a long time depending on the quality of your network connection
it will load from NCBI the fasta/fastq files of all 18 runs:
   9 Baruzzo HG19, 9 PFAL, Illumina, PacBio, Roche
   plus the iRefSeq fasta and gff files. 

All these files are copied into Fasta/$run
Because some files are paired-end files, we expect 41 files and 4 symbolic links
  ls -ls Fasta/*/*.fast[aq].gz | wc -l
 
============
============

There is now a choice, you may either download from NCBI the precomputed SAM files
or recompute them yourself

============

sam:
  To download the precomputed SAM files, please run
    tcsh MagicBlastPaperMasterScript.tcsh sam
  This command may take a very long time depending on the quality of your network connection.
It will load from NCBI the sam files for the 18 runs and for all aligners

============

align:
  To align the data on your own machine, please run
    tcsh MagicBlastPaperMasterScript.tcsh align
  Notice that the script works in lazy mode:
  if some sam files have been downloaded, the corresponding run will not be realigned

  Realigning may take a very long time and requires very large RAM, some cases
  demand more than 32 Gb of RAM. If you do not have a large hardware, we rather
  recommend that you download the precomputed SAM files as explained above.
  If you do realign, you may want to study and configure the self documented 
  file scripts/submit which can help to fan out the alignments on a compute far.

 
============
============

Analysis.

  Once the sam files are available, they are analyzed by the following three sub-commands

    aliqc : run AliQC.py on each run in the background (slow)
       Notice that the command ' MagicBlastPaperMasterScript.tcsh aliqc' requires HTSeq
       which is installed in scripts/HTSeq. This is expected to work, but if you encounter
       a problem, please study the additional information in the file scripts/HTSeq/README

       This command scans the SAM files, compares them to the reference genome and construct
       detailed statistics on the quality of the alignment and the nature of the mismatches.
    accuracy : analyze the intron found in all the BAM files and compares them to the benchmark truth
       This command runs a dedicated C program, see info in the file bin/README, which 
       compares the introns discovered in the SAM file to the benchmark truth.
    export : export QC and ROC curve of intron discovery and the histogram of aligned lengths
       The final tab delimited tables will appear in the RESULTS directory.
