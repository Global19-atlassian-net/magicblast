## This table evaluates the accuracy of the mapping by comparing in each method, read by read, the coordinates of the ends of its alignments to the unique reference alignment provided by the Baruzzo benchmark [Nature Methods 14.2 pp135-139, 2017]
## Each read is aligned uniquely in the benchmark. In each method, the aligner may recover the true chromosomal coordinates of the first and last base of the read (TP1), or provide a partial alignment included in the true segment (TP2), or overlap the true position but extend out of it (FP1), or align completely elsewhere (FP2), or fail to align (FN). 
## If a read aligns at several sites, it will count as exact (or partial) if at least one of its alignments has the same coordinates as the benchmark unique alignment (or is included). This applies to the first half of the table, columns 10 to 20, which reports on reads.
## In contrast, in the second half of the table, columns 22 to 32, which reports on alignments, each alignment is counted in its category.
## The precision (p=(TP1+TP2)/(TP1+TP2+FP1+FP2)), recall (r=(TP1+TP2)/(TP1+TP2+FN)) and F score (f=2 p r/(p+r)) are computed for reads and alignments.
## The percentage of aligned at multiple sites is shown. The percentage of reads well mapped, at the correct position, but only partially aligned is also computed.
