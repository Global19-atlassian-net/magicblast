The present directory contains scripts used in the Magic-BLAST paper analysis. 
 
===========

MagicBlastPaperMasterScript.tcsh
  is the main scripts driving the whole analysis, it calls the other scripts and the C executables
  present in the bin directory. It is described in the supplementary material of the paper.

  How to use this scripts is described in the file ../README in the parent directory

  Please check the file ../bin/README and verify if the executables work correctly on your machine
  The main difficulty may come from the installation of HTSeq needed by AliQC.py.

==========

AliQC.py
  is a python code developed in collaboration we Joe Meehan, FDA, for the
  MAQC/SEQC project led by Leming Shi several years ago. It was ported
  to python3 for the present project. The code has several functionalities
  try 'python3 AliQC.py --help', and it is called with the proper parameters
  by the master script. The purpose is to scan the SAM files, which can appear
  indifferently as BAM, SAM, or SAM.gz files, and to extract detailed statistics
  on the alignments and error patterns.
  Notice that AliQC.py does not import a truth file, so all 
  the measurement are intrinsic to the SAM file. 
  Comparisons to the 'truth' of the benchmarks is delegated to the C code 'bin/sam2gold'.
  AliQC calls HTSeq to parse the SAM files.

==========

HTSeq is described in the following publication:

    Simon Anders, Paul Theodor Pyl, Wolfgang Huber
    HTSeq — A Python framework to work with high-throughput sequencing data
    Bioinformatics 2015 Jan 15; 31(2): 166–169.

  It is  a python library that is used by AliQC.py solely to parse the SAM files into 
  an object-oriented format, the analysis itself being programmed in AliQC.py.
  It is very possible that HTSeq will not work on your machine because it directly
  imports precompiled python object modules (.so files). If it does not work, please 
  follow the instructions in scripts/HTSeq/README

===========

transpose (which calls transpose.awk)
  is a simple utility to transpose any tab delimited file
  Usage
    cat f1 | scripts/transpose > f2
  It is used by the other scripts.

===========

tags
  is a simple utility to sort and count entries in the first column of a file
  Usage
    tags f1     # in this case the first column ends on the first tab or space
    tags -t f1  # in this case the first column ends on the first tab
  It is used by the other scripts.

===========

submit
  is a script to control the parallelization of large programs
  It is by default configured to allow 4 programs to run in parallel,
  see line 51, e.g. edit (NCORE = 4) into (NCORE = 8).
  By select 'farm = local' on line 16, the submissions would
  become purely sequential. If you have access to a SLURM compute-farm, 
  you could submit on the farm by uncommenting line 23
  and editing your accounts around line 260. Other farms would be
  relatively easy to configure.

==========

directErrorCount.awk, gff2cig.awk, introns_precision_recall.awk, transpose.awk
  are format changing scripts called by the other scripts
